Scripts and tools for use with Team Foundation Server.  Includes:

tfpurge.bat - Identifies large files in TFS version control and automatically
              generates a list of tf.exe commands that can be used to destroy
              older revisions of those files in order to conserve space.

              Tested under Strawberry Perl 5.12.3 together with Team Foundation
              Server 2008.
 
              This is a Perl script, but is wrapped in a batch file so that it
              may be run directly even if a file association for .pl files has
              not been defined.  Assumes that perl.exe and tf.exe are found in
              %PATH%.
